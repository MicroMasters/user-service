# User Microservice Project

Welcome to the User Microservice project! This project is built using the Go programming language and is designed to manage user roles and access through APIs. It utilizes JWT token authentication for validating users and MongoDB for database management, along with Redis for caching authentication and session management.

## Roles

The User Microservice project supports the following user roles:

1. **Guest**: Users who are not logged in or authenticated.
2. **Buyer**: Users who have registered as buyers and have access to specific buyer functionalities.
3. **Supplier**: Users who have registered as suppliers and have access to supplier-specific functionalities.
4. **Admin**: Users with administrative privileges, granting them access to manage users, roles, and other administrative tasks.
